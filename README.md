# Hindi Machine-Generated Text Detection
This research project address the challenge of detecting  wheather a peice of text written in **Hindi** language was written by human or generated by **large language models**(LLMs) such as GPT, Gemini and LLaMA3

##  Overview

This project focuses on:

-  Generating Hindi text using LLMs like **Gemini** and **LLaMA3**
-  Detecting machine-generated text with models like **BERT**, **DetectGPT**, **GPTZero**, and **Radar**
-  Evaluating which methods are most effective at detecting synthetic Hindi text

The label convention is as follows:

1: Human-written text
0: Machine-generated (AI-generated) text

Datasets:
i. Xquade - text/keywords generation in hindi using Gemini and llama 

ii. HindiSumm - Hindi summarization via Gemini and llama

# How to Run
Use gemini_hindisumm.py, llama3_hindisumm.py, or xquad scripts to generate Hindi content.

# Navigate to METHODS/ and run one of the detection methods.
Some scripts contain both training and inference. Comment out training blocks if you're only testing.
